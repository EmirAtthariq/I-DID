# I-DID
## Your Success, Your Story

This is my first app for MotionLab Mobile Programming Kotlin internship

## The story behind this app
I was inspired to make this app because every so often whenever I did anything whether it's good or bad, I usually just forget about it, even when it impacts my life quite a bit, and I'm the type of person who likes to have something spesific
for something so when I tried to write what I did for the day on my notebook, I got the idea to make this app so I can write it anywhere easily and having a spesific app for this is really helpful for me

## Current Main Features
-Adding a new note
-Editing a note
-Deleting a note
-Favoriting a note
-Account Login and Registration
-Quotes of the day

I'm currently improving this app and are going to fix a few bugs that I've found for now
