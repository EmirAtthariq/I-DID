# I-DID: Your Life, Your Story
Do you ever did anything you're so proud of that you want to remember it forever? or something that you're ashamed of that you want to make sure you never going to do that again? With this app you can write down all of that and make sure that you will never forget it ever again

This is my first app for MotionLab Mobile Programming Kotlin internship

## The Story Behind This App
I was inspired to make this app because every so often whenever I did anything whether it's good or bad, I usually just forget about it, even when it impacts my life quite a bit, and I'm the type of person who likes to have something specific for anything so when I tried to write what I did for the day on my notebook, I got the idea to make this app so I can write it anywhere easily and having a specific app for this is really helpful for me

## Current Main Features
-Adding a new note

-Editing a note

-Deleting a note

-Favoriting a note

-Account Login and Registration

-Quotes of the day for your daily motivation
